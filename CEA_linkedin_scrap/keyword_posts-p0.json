That is why we have placed it at the heart of SOITECS's strategy and have developed a #SustainabilityByDesign approach to implement eco-design in our production processes.\n \nTo move forward on this path, we rely on the commitment and #diversity of our employees. Having a working environment with different backgrounds, skills, experience and knowledge will ensure the emergence of innovative and creative ideas.\n \nThis diversity is also a strength in delivering high quality solutions to our customers, bringing unique value to the mobile communications, automotive, industrial and smart device markets through our engineered wafers that deliver significant energy savings and superior performance to the end user.\n \nAnd, as a key player in the global semiconductor industry expected to reach $1T by 2030, we are convinced that strong collaboration in the European ecosystem will enable the development of global projects, such as those we have already participated in at EU level: Beyond 5 for radio frequency electronics, Transform for sustainable #ElectricMobility and StorAIge in the development of FD-SOI technologies for #AI.\n \nWe are proud to promote sustainability throughout the semiconductor value chain and to advance it with the help of our partners in Europe.","date_string":"2w •  ","likes":402,"comments":4},{"postID":"7030080195059412992","author":"AppCyclers","content":"This week, we had a productive engagement with Clara Santato and  Pierre-Jean Alarco from Polytechnic Montreal on the Collaborative Research and Training Experience in Sustainable Electronics and Eco-Design (CREATE SEED). They came to discuss the potential for student mobility exchange. During their visit, we had a breakfast meeting with the Vice Chancellor and Deans of faculties of Tamale Technical University, where discussions were held on the objectives of the student mobility project, its implementation prospects, and the potency of its benefits. Professor Clara Santato also gave a fascinating presentation on CREATE SEED and the recovery of precious metals from e-waste. The highlight of the visit was a tour of the university's laboratories, where we had the opportunity to explore ways of leveraging them to achieve greater impact.
